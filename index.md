## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:

~~~
├── _featured_categories
│   └── example.md
├── _projects
│   └── *
├── docs
├── example
├── licenses
├── assets
│   └── img
│       ├── blog
│       ├── docs
│       └── projects
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── forms-by-example.md
├── LICENSE.md
└── NOTICE.md
~~~

Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a Windows SRE @Google.

This website aims to document *interesting* tech problems I've
solved, and share those solutions with the world in the hopes that it will make
your life easier.

TsekNet is a play on words, being a mix of my last name, "[**Tsek**hanskiy](/about#last-name)", and Microsoft's "Tech**Net**".
