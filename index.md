## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
{:.related-posts.faded}

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:

~~~

│   └── example.md
├── _projects
│   └── *
├── docs
├── example
├── licenses
├── assets

├── CHANGELOG.md
├── forms-by-example.md
├── LICENSE.md
└── NOTICE.md
~~~

[documentation]: docs/README.md
