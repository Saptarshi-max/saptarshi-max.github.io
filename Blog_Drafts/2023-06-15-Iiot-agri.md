  Agriculture is more than just a practice or an industry; it's about yielding enough crops and food resources for the global population, minimizing food wastes, eradicating pests and plant diseases, and efficient management of organic resources. It is a critical foundation for global sustenance, environmental stability, and the overall well-being of present and future generations.
