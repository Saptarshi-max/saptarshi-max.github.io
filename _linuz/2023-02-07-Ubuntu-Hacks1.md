Ubuntu, my personal favourite Linux distribution Which was launched back in 2004 by the UK-based company Canonical, Today is the most widely used distribution of Linux on the desktop computers running on Linux. Apart from having a significant market share among desktop Linux operating systems, It is packaged in 3 different editions:

1. Desktop 
2. Server
3. Core for IoT devices


Lets start with the Server Edition, 



Ubuntu comes in 3 different editions
~~~c++
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout <<"Hello";  //String literal 
    return 0;
}
~~~
