  From Automation systems, Mobile phones to Real time Medical systems ARM devices has been at the heart of every systems required to provide high level computational processing sometimes even in high constraint environment. Raising the question, what makes the ARM processor series so unique?

Some Work here and trhere 

## The Boot Process




## The Cortex M Series 

### Programmer's Model 

### Exception Model 

### Fault Handling

### Peripherals

#### Floating Point Unit 


#### Nested Vector Interrupt 

#### System Timer, Systick 

### CMSIS Features 

### Power Management


## The Architecture 

The ARM architecture Core register set is as shown below, 
- The ARM processor, like all RISC processors, uses a load-store architecture.

The ARM processor can run in multiple modes,
