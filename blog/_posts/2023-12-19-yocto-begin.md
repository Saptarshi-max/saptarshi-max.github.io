  The Yocto Project is an open-source framework and set of tools that facilitates the creation of customized Linux-based operating systems for embedded systems. It provides a collection of recipes, metadata, and build scripts, allowing developers to configure and build a tailored Linux distribution for specific hardware platforms and application requirements.

## What is the Yocto Project ?

Yocto project is super popular in the world of Linux. But No, unlike Ubuntu or fedora it is not a Linux distribution itself but rather a collection of tools and metadata that enable developers to build customized Linux distributions for embedded systems. The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that focuses on building from source code to create tailored Linux distribution that provides templates, tools, and methods to help create custom Linux-based embedded systems.


## Components of the Yocto Project 

The core components of Yocto Project are :

|  The Component | Description  |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|  **Poky** | Poky is the reference distribution of the Yocto Project. It provides metadata, scripts, and configuration files for building custom Linux distributions.  |
| **BitBake** |  BitBake is the build engine used by the Yocto Project. It executes tasks defined in recipes to build packages and images.   |
| **OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core)** |   |
| **Recipes** |   Recipes define how to build a specific software component. They include information such as source location, dependencies, and build instructions.  |
| **Metadata**|    Metadata includes recipes, configuration files, and other information that refers to the build instructions themselves, as well as the data used to control what things get built and the effects of the build. Metadata also includes commands and data used to indicate what versions of software used.  |
| **Classes** |     |
| **Machines**| |
